# Sentiment-Analyzis
The movies dataset is too large to download it on GitHub, so check it on this website: http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/. After downloading it save the raw data in the reviews_data/movies/raw/ folder so that the algorithm works correctly.

For Amazon dataset you can find pretrained Doc2Vec model and doc2vec vectors of all reviews in reviews_data folder
